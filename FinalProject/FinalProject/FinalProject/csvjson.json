    "Execution": "Move head away from pulley by bending neck forward until chin touches upper chest. Return head by hyperextending neck and repeat.",
    "Comment": "Positioning pulley higher will alter tension curve by decreasing effort required near initiation of concentric contraction while increasing effort required near end of concentric contraction. Positioning pulley slightly higher than what is shown will allow greater effort in middle of movement."

    "Utility": "Auxiliary",
    "Mechanics": "Isolated",
    "Force": "Pull",
    "Preparation": "Grasp dumbbells to each side. Bend knees and bend over through hips with back flat, close to horizontal. Position elbows with slight bend and palms facing together.",
    "Execution": "Raise upper arms to sides until elbows are shoulder height. Maintain upper arms perpendicular to torso and fixed elbow position (10° to 30° angle) throughout exercise. Maintain height of elbows above wrists by raising \"pinkie finger\" side up. Lower and repeat.",
    "Comment": "Dumbbells are raised by shoulder transverse abduction, not external rotation, nor extension. Upper arm should travel in perpendicular path to torso to minimize relatively powerful latissimus dorsi involvement. In other words, at top of movement, elbows (not necessarily dumbbells) should be directly lateral to shoulders since elbows are slightly bent forward."

To exercise posterior deltoid and not lateral deltoid, keep upper torso close to horizontal. Positioning upper torso at 45° is not sufficient angle to target rear deltoids. The spine can be flexed to achieve this positioning if thighs can provide sufficient support for torso. Some individuals may not be able to bend sufficiently at hip due to flexibility or girth constraints. Also see Rear Lateral Raise Errors and Low Back Alignment Exceptions."

Bar is brought downward anywhere between chin and upper chest. As to minimize shoulder involvement, keep elbows up, allowing elbow to fold upon itself.

    "Preparation": "Grasp suspension handles and momentarily step back until arms are extended forward and straight. While keeping arms straight and shoulders back, step forward so body is reclined back. Position palms up or slightly inward.",
    "Execution": "Bring handles toward shoulders by flexing arms, while keeping elbows pointed forward. Return by straightening arms and repeat.",
    "Comment": "Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright. Also known as Suspended Biceps Curl, arguably somewhat of a misnomer. The positioning of arms, with elbows high, places short head (medial head) of Bicep Brachii in active insufficiency as arm continues to flex. The long head of Biceps Brachii (lateral head) and in particular, Brachialis are primary movers in this position."

Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility ). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either knees should be bent more or torso may not be positioned as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more shoulder transverse extension  and less shoulder extension  range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension."

    "Target": "Rectus Abdominis",
    "Utility": "Basic",
    "Mechanics": "Compound",
    "Force": "Pull",
    "Preparation": "Place weight between ankles. Stand between parallel bars and grip bar on each side with overhand grip. Lift body off floor and balance body upright with arms straight.",
    "Execution": "Raise legs by flexing hips and knees until hips are fully flexed. Continue to raise knees toward shoulders by flexing waist. Return until waist, hips, and knees are extended. Repeat.",
    "Comment": "This exercise is alternative to Vertical Leg-hip Raise when apparatus is not available, or Hanging Leg-hip Raise when high bar is not available or too low to allow for adequate leg clearance. Exercise can be performed without added weight until more resistance is needed."

    "Preparation": "Position back against back pad with knees slightly bent, shoulders back, and chest high. Place both cable straps over shoulders, one in each hand.

    "Comment": "To allow for full range of motion, grip height on strap should not allow weight to bottom out (weights touching stack) when shoulders are back. Padded hump should be adjusted to height of low back. See Spot Reduction Myth."

    "Comment": "Certain individuals may need to keep their neck in neutral position with space between their chin and sternum. If no knee support is built in to incline board, ball can be placed under legs. If upper back does not come completely down at end of movement, abdominal muscles may only be isometrically involved in exercise. Pectineus, Adductor Longus, and Brevis do not assist in hip flexion since hips are already initially bent. Knee flexors may be involved as stabilizers if incline is steep and no calf support is used.

Return weight to blocks by bending hips back and knees pointed outward, while keeping chest high and back straight. Repeat.",
    "Comment": "Use shoulder width grip since narrower than shoulder width grip will make it more difficult to lockout at top. Throughout lift, keep hips low, shoulders high, arms and back straight, and knees pointed out same direction as feet. Also, keep bar close to body to improve mechanical leverage. With wide stance, push feet out to sides and not down to prevent knees from buckling inward. Pushing knees out will allow hips to travel toward bar more quickly while improving leverage."

    "Execution": "Lower bar to floor while raising lifted leg back behind. Keep back straight and knee of supporting leg slightly bent. Keep hip and knee of lifted leg extended throughout movement. Once stretch is felt or barbell contacts floor, return to original position by raising torso while lowering lifted leg. Straighten knee of supporting leg as torso becomes upright. Repeat.",
    "Comment": "Throughout lift, keep arms and back straight. Do not lower weight beyond mild stretch throughout hamstrings. Full range of motion will vary from person to person. Those with less flexibility may need to bend knee of supporting leg more so barbell can contact floor. At top of movement, lifted foot can make contact with floor to maintain balance between repetitions."

    "Comment": "Exercise name is somewhat counter-intuitive since direction of rotation is relative to movement of hip, or thigh, not bent leg. For example, in this exercises, internal rotation of hip causes front of thigh to turn inward despite bent leg moving outward.

    "Comment": "Height of knee on exercising leg may require subtle adjustment during movement to permit clearance of traveling foot above floor.

Extend right leg forward as left heal rises off ground.Extend left foot as left hip and knee terminate extension propelling body forward as both feet are no longer in contact with ground. Begin to swing left arm back and right arm forward. Continue to extend right knee in preparation for initial landing while raising left heel toward buttock. Right foot makes contact with ground, then right knee bends as it quickly travels underneath body.Repeat jogging pattern with opposite leg, alternating between sides. Continue jogging at comfortable pace until specific distance is covered or prescribed time has elapsed.",
    "Comment": "Jogging involves traveling at a pace of less than 6 mph (~10 kmph), while running involves anything faster than 6 mph (~10 kmph). Body leans forward during initial take-off stride. Afterwhich, keep body and head more upright throughout jog. Alternative initiation form involves leaning forward at left ankle while stepping forward with right leg. To lean from ankles, lean whole body forward until body begins to fall forward. Immediately step forward and begin running.Arm swing to opposes high rotational forces produced from the legs to maintain straighter forward path during running. Swing arms opposite to legs with arms bent to sides and shoulders and hands relaxed. After foot makes contact with ground, allow knee to bend slightly so leg absorbs impact and so it can later extend behind body."
