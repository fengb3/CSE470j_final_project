This exercise AKA \"prone full can\" has been suggested to exercise supraspinatus muscle in rehabilitation settings (Blackburn TA, et al. 1990; Reinold MM, et al. 2007)."

    "Target": "Brachialis",
    "Utility": "Auxiliary",
    "Mechanics": "Isolated",
    "Force": "Pull",
    "Preparation": "Grasp suspension handles and momentarily step back until arms are extended forward and straight. While keeping arms straight and shoulders back, step forward so body is reclined back. Position palms up or slightly inward.",
    "Execution": "Bring handles toward shoulders by flexing arms, while keeping elbows pointed forward. Return by straightening arms and repeat.",
    "Comment": "Dismounting can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright. Also known as Suspended Biceps Curl, arguably somewhat of a misnomer. The positioning of arms, with elbows high, places short head (medial head) of Bicep Brachii in active insufficiency as arm continues to flex. The long head of Biceps Brachii (lateral head) and in particular, Brachialis are primary movers in this position."

Begin with light weight and add additional weight gradually to allow lower back adequate adaptation. Do not pause or bounce at bottom of lift. Do not lower weight beyond mild stretch. Full range of motion through lower back will vary from person to person. For even greater hip and low back articulation, hips may be slid back further with knees straighter."

Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility ). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings, either knees should be bent more or torso may not be positioned as low. Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more shoulder transverse extension  and less shoulder extension  range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form, deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse extension."

    "Comment": "Exercise can be performed without added weight until more resistance is needed. Rectus Abdominis and Obliques dynamically contract only if actual waist flexion occurs. With no waist flexion, Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only isometrically contract to stabilize pelvis and waist during hip flexion; see Weighted Vertical Leg Raise. It may be necessary to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible. See Spot Reduction Myth and Lower Ab Myth."

    "Execution": "Lift bar by extending hips and knees to full extension. Pull shoulders back at top of lift if rounded. Return and repeat.",
    "Comment": "Throughout lift, keep hips low, shoulders high, arms and back straight. Knees should point same direction as feet throughout movement. Keep bar close to body to improve mechanical leverage. Grip strength and strength endurance often limit ability to perform multiple reps at heavy resistances. Gym chalk, wrist straps, grip work, and mixed grip can be used to enhance grip. Mixed grip indicates one hand holding with overhand grip and other hand holding with underhand grip."

    "Comment": "Use shoulder width grip since narrower than shoulder width grip will make it more difficult to lockout at top. Throughout lift, keep hips low, shoulders high, arms and back straight, and knees pointed out same direction as feet. Also, keep bar close to body to improve mechanical leverage. With wide stance, push feet out to sides and not down to prevent knees from buckling inward. Pushing knees out will allow hips to travel toward bar more quickly while improving leverage."

    "Utility": "Auxiliary",
    "Mechanics": "Isolated",
    "Force": "Pull",
    "Preparation": "Hold barbell down in front, arms straight with shoulder width or slightly wider overhand grip. Stand with feet together. Lift leg slightly so foot is just off floor.",
    "Execution": "Lower bar to floor while raising lifted leg back behind. Keep back straight and knee of supporting leg slightly bent. Keep hip and knee of lifted leg extended throughout movement. Once stretch is felt or barbell contacts floor, return to original position by raising torso while lowering lifted leg. Straighten knee of supporting leg as torso becomes upright. Repeat.",
    "Comment": "Throughout lift, keep arms and back straight. Do not lower weight beyond mild stretch throughout hamstrings. Full range of motion will vary from person to person. Those with less flexibility may need to bend knee of supporting leg more so barbell can contact floor. At top of movement, lifted foot can make contact with floor to maintain balance between repetitions."

    "Comment": "Try to keep knees from traveling forward while reaching rear end back onto squat box. Ideally, knees could be behind ankles. In this position, greater stretch reflex can be created through hips (via hamstrings) once torso rocks forward just before squat.

    "Execution": "Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90Â°, pull cable attachment under thigh of stationary leg by rotating hip. Return until slight stretch is felt in hip, then repeat. Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue facing opposite direction.",
    "Comment": "Height of knee on exercising leg may require subtle adjustment during movement to permit clearance of traveling foot above floor. Gluteus Maximus will be activated as stabilizer on heavier loads when participant pushes stationary foot onto floor thereby anchoring lower body as hip adductors keep thighs together. Upper body muscles can also assist in keeping thigh of exercising leg along side stationary leg. Exercise name is somewhat counter-intuitive since direction of rotation is relative to movement of hip, or thigh, not bent leg. For example, in this exercises, external rotation of hip causes front of thigh to turn outward despite bent leg moving inward. Incidentally if knee were straight during external rotation of thigh, foot would move outward."

Erector Spinae becomes stabilizer if spine is kept straight. See Side Rear View."

Begin to swing left arm back and right arm forward. Continue to extend right knee in preparation for initial landing while raising left heel toward buttock. Right foot makes contact with ground, then right knee bends as it quickly travels underneath body.Repeat jogging pattern with opposite leg, alternating between sides. Continue jogging at comfortable pace until specific distance is covered or prescribed time has elapsed.",
    "Comment": "Jogging involves traveling at a pace of less than 6 mph (~10 kmph), while running involves anything faster than 6 mph (~10 kmph). Body leans forward during initial take-off stride. Afterwhich, keep body and head more upright throughout jog. Alternative initiation form involves leaning forward at left ankle while stepping forward with right leg. To lean from ankles, lean whole body forward until body begins to fall forward. Immediately step forward and begin running.Arm swing to opposes high rotational forces produced from the legs to maintain straighter forward path during running. Swing arms opposite to legs with arms bent to sides and shoulders and hands relaxed. After foot makes contact with ground, allow knee to bend slightly so leg absorbs impact and so it can later extend behind body."
